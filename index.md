### The paper contains two complementary studies.

* #### In [Study 1](https://github.com/jpaulodiniz/jpaulodiniz.github.io/tree/main/SSHOMs/2023ISSRE/Study1), we investigate whether one of the SS2OMs' constituent FOMs is reaching the other.

* #### In [Study 2](https://github.com/jpaulodiniz/jpaulodiniz.github.io/tree/main/SSHOMs/2023ISSRE/Study2), we propose a novel search strategy for SS2OMs taking into account a 2OM only when one of its constituent FOMs reaches the other.
